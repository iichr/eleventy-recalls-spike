title: Vehicle Recalls Service

The Vehicle Recalls Service provides two solutions which vehicle manufacturers can use to supply vehicle recall data to DVSA:

- [API](/api/) (Application Programming Interface)
- [SFTP](/sftp/) (Secure File Transfer Protocol)

Only send data for vehicles with recalls that have been approved by DVSA. This includes safety recalls and non-safety/environmental recalls. Do not send data for:

- Service campaigns (no recall)
- Recalls that have not been launched

UK-only data is preferred.

Supplying the data will allow DVSA to:

- increase recall rectification rates (and road safety) by informing the public of outstanding recalls on their vehicles through MOT digital services
- track the overall progress of recall campaigns

More information on how DVSA will use the data can be found in the Information Sharing Agreement.
