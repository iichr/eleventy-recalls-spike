The Vehicle Recalls Service provides two solutions which vehicle manufacturers can use to supply safety recall data to DVSA:

- [API](/api/) (Application Programming Interface)
- [SFTP](/sftp/) (Secure File Transfer Protocol)

Only send data for vehicles with safety recalls that have been approved by DVSA. UK-only data is preferred. Do not send data for:

- Non-safety recalls (non-code action)
- Service campaigns (no recall)

Supplying the data will allow DVSA to:

- increase recall rectification rates (and road safety) by informing the public of outstanding safety recalls on their vehicles through MOT digital services
- track the overall progress of recall campaigns

More information on how DVSA will use the data can be found in the Information Sharing Agreement.
